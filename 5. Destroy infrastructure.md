# Destroy Infrastructure

When you no longer need infrastructure managed by Terraform, you can destroy it to reduce costs, security exposure, and resource overhead. Terraform's `destroy` command removes all resources defined in your Terraform state file.

### Destroy Command

Run the following command to destroy the Docker container and image created earlier:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Terraform will generate an execution plan showing resources marked for destruction (indicated by the `-` prefix):

```
##...
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.
```

### Execution Plan & Confirmation

1. **Review the Plan**:  
   Terraform lists resources to destroy (e.g., `docker_container.nginx` and `docker_image.nginx`).

2. **Confirm Destruction**:  
   Enter `yes` when prompted to proceed:
   ```
   Do you really want to destroy all resources?
     Enter a value: yes
   ```

### Destruction Process

Terraform destroys resources sequentially, respecting dependencies. In this example:

```
docker_container.nginx: Destroying... [id=b2140f8c...]
docker_container.nginx: Destruction complete after 2s
docker_image.nginx: Destroying... [id=sha256:d1a...]
docker_image.nginx: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

### Key Notes

- **Dependency Order**: Terraform automatically destroys resources in an order that avoids conflicts (e.g., containers before images if dependencies exist).
- **State File**: Only resources tracked in the Terraform state are destroyed. External resources remain unaffected.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for short-lived environments (e.g., testing) or decommissioning production systems safely.
