# What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC enables you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

## Terraform Overview

Terraform is HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files and manage your infrastructure's lifecycle. Using Terraform offers several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure:

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.
- **Human-Readable Language**: The configuration language is simple and helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
- **State Management**: Terraform's state feature tracks resource changes throughout deployments.
- **Version Control**: You can commit configurations to version control systems to safely collaborate on infrastructure.

### Manage Any Infrastructure

Terraform plugins, called providers, allow Terraform to interact with cloud platforms and other services via their APIs. The Terraform Registry includes over 1,000 providers created by HashiCorp and the community. These providers manage resources across platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub, Splunk, and DataDog. If a provider you need doesnâ€™t exist, you can write your own.

### Standardize Your Deployment Workflow

Providers define individual units of infrastructure, such as compute instances or private networks, as resources. You can compose resources from different providers into reusable Terraform configurations called modules and manage them with a consistent language and workflow.

Terraform's configuration language is declarative, meaning it describes the desired end state of your infrastructure rather than requiring step-by-step instructions. Terraform providers automatically calculate dependencies between resources to create or destroy them in the correct order.

### Steps to Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform:

1. **Scope**: Identify the infrastructure needed for your project.
2. **Author**: Write the configuration for your infrastructure.
3. **Initialize**: Install the plugins Terraform needs to manage the infrastructure.
4. **Plan**: Preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration.
5. **Apply**: Execute the planned changes.

### Track Your Infrastructure

Terraform keeps track of your real infrastructure in a state file, which serves as the source of truth for your environment. The state file helps Terraform determine the necessary changes to align your infrastructure with your configuration.

### Collaborate on Infrastructure

Terraform supports collaboration through remote state backends. By using HCP Terraform (free for up to five users), you can:

- Securely share your state with teammates.
- Provide a stable environment for Terraform runs.
- Prevent race conditions when multiple users make configuration changes simultaneously.

You can also connect HCP Terraform to version control systems (VCS) such as GitHub and GitLab. This integration automatically proposes infrastructure changes when you commit configuration changes, enabling you to manage infrastructure updates as you would application code.
